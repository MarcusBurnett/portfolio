      'I joined a small team, 3 front-end developers and 5 back-end, when the company had roughly 250k members. Within 2 years, we had over 1 million members and not only was I a key part of the development of our apps, as well as those of partners such as O2, I have been heavily involved with the design process. I was responsible for moving all designs to Sketch Cloud, creating component libraries for everyone in the business to use and designing many new apps and features. Once I had gained enough experience, I also had the opportunity to mentor junior developers as the team grew, which has definitely aided my personal development.',

      'Code Nation was the start of my career as a developer. I spent 12 weeks there, learning the basics and becoming accustomed to life as a dev. We started with HTML, CSS and Javascript, before moving onto React for a couple of weeks. We then learnt about the back end, both SQL and No SQL, before ending with developing iOS apps with Swift. Each task came with a project, and while the course itself did not meet expectations, I was so determined to succeed that I often studied 12 hours a day so that I could be at the required level to get my first job.',
